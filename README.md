- `interview/`: Handles the structure and flow of mock interviews.
- `nnlms/`: Core settings, URLs, and configurations.
- `static/` & `templates/`: Static assets and template files for rendering the front end.

## Websocket Integration
- The project uses **Django Channels** to manage websockets, enabling real-time communication between clients and the server.
- Websockets are used in `live_class/` for managing real-time interactions during class sessions.

## Deployment
- Use the `Procfile` for deployment to Heroku:
